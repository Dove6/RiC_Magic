# RiC_Magic
Unity clone of magic duel minigame from "Reksio i Czarodzieje" ["Rex and the Wizards"].  
I hope to understand minigame mechanics in order to reimplement it on the original game engine.

### What have I learnt so far here...
* including audio clips,
* basic animation,
* basic AI,
* timing things,
* handling mouse input (escpecially tracing position),
* unsing particle system,
* ... (more incoming)
